# Linear-Regression-Scratch

📌 Project Overview

This project implements Linear Regression from scratch using Python and Gradient Descent — without relying on machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

Dataset: (x, y) points (scatter plot).

Goal: Fit the best line 
𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥+𝑏
y=mx+b that minimizes error.

Method: Gradient Descent optimization.

Output: Fitted line plotted alongside data points.
